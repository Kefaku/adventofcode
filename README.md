These are my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in C#. These are certainly not the shortest or fastest solutions out there, but I tried to make them readable enough for everyone to understand and practice with.

As I don't want to give away any spoilers, the results will not be available on the day the challenge is published.
